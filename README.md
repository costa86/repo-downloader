# Repo Cloner
[![MIT License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-green.svg)](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/)

This program clones multiple GitHub repositories. 

# Providing the repositories
The program takes a JSON file that defines the repositories to be cloned. Use [repos.json](repos.json) as a template.

```json
[
    {
        "folder": "autogit",
        "url": "https://github.com/costa86/autogit.git"
    },
    {
        "folder": "coppy",
        "url": "https://github.com/costa86/coppy"
    }
]
```

# Usage
Just run the executable, providing the JSON file as the first parameter. Like so:
    
    ./repo-download-linux repos.json

|OS|Executable|
|--|--|
|Windows|[repo-download-windows.exe](repo-download-windows.exe)|
|Linux|[repo-download-linux](repo-download-linux)|
|MacOS|[repo-download-darwin](repo-download-darwin)|


It clones each repository into the specified local folder.

# Concurrent cloning

The program was built in Go, which takes advantage of the Goroutines to clone repositories concurrently. This maximizes throughput by cloning them simultaneously.
